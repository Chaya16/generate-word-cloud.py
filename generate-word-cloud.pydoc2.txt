FUNCTIONS
    exit(...)
        exit([status])
        
        Exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit(status).
        If the status is omitted or None, it defaults to zero (i.e., success).
        If the status is an integer, it will be used as the system exit status.
        If it is another kind of object, it will be printed and the system
        exit status will be one (i.e., failure).
    
    generate(text, max_words=200, width=800, height=600)
        Generate a word cloud image from the given text (one huge string).
    
    main(argv)
        Use the arguments of the command line.
    
    makeimage(wordcloud, outname='wordcloud.png', title='Word cloud', show=False, force=False)
        Display or save the wordcloud as a image.
    
    readfiles(filenames)
        Return the content of each file, concatenated as one big string.
        
        - Path could be relative or absolute, but nothing fancy is done here.
